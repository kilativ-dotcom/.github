# The OSTIS Technology project

The OSTIS project is focused on the development of intelligent computer systems with a high level of intelligence and a high level of socialization. 
These systems, developed according to OSTIS technologies, are called as ostis-systems.

The OSTIS technology is implemented as a network of ostis-systems, which is part of the Ecosystem OSTIS. The key ostis system of this network is 
the Intelligent MetaSystem for ostis-systems, which implements the OSTIS Technology Core, which includes basic (subject-independent) methods and 
tools for designing and manufacturing ostis-systems with integration into their composition of typical built-in subsystems for supporting operation and 
reengineering ostis-systems. The remaining ostis-systems that are part of the network under consideration implement various specialized ostis 
technologies for designing various classes of ostis systems, providing automation of any areas and types of human activity, except designing ostis-systems.

## Main goal products of project

- Comprehensive open semantic technology for design, production, operation and reinvention engineering of hybrid, semantically compatible, active and 
negotiable intellectual computer systems, named The OSTIS Standard and writing in the form of sources of wide-ranging, consistent and extensible 
knowledge base of subject areas and ontologies;
- The Intelligent MetaSystem, based the OSTIS Technology, to automate designing and manufacturing, operation and reengineering ostis-systems, 
named IMS-ostis, that includes the OSTIS Standard knowldge base;
